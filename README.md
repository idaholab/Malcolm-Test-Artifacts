# Malcolm-Test-Artifacts

This repository contains artifacts required by the Malcolm-Test project ([GitHub](https://github.com/idaholab/Malcolm-Test), [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/malcolm-test/)), including PCAP files and Windows Event Log backup (.evtx) files.

In some cases, PCAP files have been merged and [aligned chronologically](./tools/pcap_time_shift.py) but are otherwise unaltered. I do not claim ownership nor responsibility for the PCAP files nor their contents.

â›”ðŸ†˜ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€ **Some of the PCAPs *may* contain examples of malware in their payloads. Use at your own risk.** ðŸ’€ðŸ˜­ðŸ†˜â›”

For a list of external links to PCAP sets, see [external-links](./external-links/README.md).
