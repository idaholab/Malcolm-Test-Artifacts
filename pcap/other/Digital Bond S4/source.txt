S4x15 - Digital Bond's S4 conference 2015

See https://www.netresec.com/?page=DigitalBond_S4

We've received permission from Dale Peterson and Reid Wightman to publish PCAP files from the SCADA Security Scientific Symposium 2015 (S4x15). The PCAP files were captured during the S4x15 Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competition, which was conducted in an ICS Village containing a variety of PLC's, HMI workstations and standard corporate IT PC's. A more detailed description of the S4x15 CTF and the devices in the ICS Village is available in a blog post at Digital Bond.

PCAP files from industrial control system networks is a scarce resource, so would like to thank Digital Bond and the S4 conference for allowing these PCAP files to be publicly shared.
